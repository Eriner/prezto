Prezto â€” Instantly Awesome Zsh
==============================

This is a fork of the [original semi-abandoned Prezto][9] maintained by Sorin Ionescu.

NOTICE
======

I will no longer be making contributions to this fork. Instead, I have created my own configuration framework; [Zim](https://github.com/Eriner/zim). 
I suggest anyone using my fork of prezto take a look at [Zim](https://github.com/Eriner/zim). 

I created this fork with the intent to maintain prezto in Sorin's absence. 
After spending many, many hours with the codebase, I decided the best thing to do was to create a new project with the same goal, but done better.

[Zim](https://github.com/Eriner/zim) is the product of this, and takes much inspiration from oh-my-zsh and prezto.
One of the main goals was to improve the speed even more, [which I've done](https://github.com/Eriner/zim/wiki/Speed).




Installation
------------

Prezto will work with any recent release of Zsh, but the minimum required
version is 4.3.17.

  1. Launch Zsh:

        zsh

  2. Clone the repository:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Eriner/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"

  3. Create a new Zsh configuration by copying the Zsh configuration files
     provided:

        setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
        for rcfile in "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/runcoms/^README.md(.N); do
          ln -s "$rcfile" "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.${rcfile:t}"
        done

    NB: The above will not overwrite or update any existing `.zshrc`. Therefore, if you
    have an existing `.zshrc` you must manually add the lines: 

		if [[ -s "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto/init.zsh" ]]; then
		source "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto/init.zsh"
		fi

  4. Set Zsh as your default shell:

        chsh -s /bin/zsh

  5. Open a new Zsh terminal window or tab.

### Troubleshooting

If you are not able to find certain commands after switching to *Prezto*,
modify the `PATH` variable in *~/.zprofile* then open a new Zsh terminal
window or tab.

Updating
--------

Pull the latest changes and update submodules.

    git pull && git submodule update --init --recursive

Usage
-----

Prezto has many features disabled by default. Read the source code and
accompanying README files to learn what features are available.

### Modules

  1. Browse [.zprezto/modules][10] to see what is available.
  2. Load the modules you need in *~/.zpreztorc* then open a new Zsh terminal
     window or tab.

### Themes

  1. For a list of themes, type `prompt -l`.
  2. To preview a theme, type `prompt -p name`.
  3. Load the theme you like in *~/.zpreztorc* then open a new Zsh terminal
     window or tab.
